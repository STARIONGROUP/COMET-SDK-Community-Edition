It provides a unique hash to the file content of the file and was selected for future compatibility with a GIT (<a href="http://git-scm.com/">http://git-scm.com/</a>) version controlled file store. Implementations of E-TM-10-25 need to provide a way to associate a SHA-1 hash to the content of a file. Whether or not the content of two FileRevisions differs can then be determined by just comparing the SHA-1 hashes without the need for having access to the actual file content itself.
