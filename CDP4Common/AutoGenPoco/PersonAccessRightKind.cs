In other words, READ access to the union of Persons referenced by Participants in the union of EngineeringModelSetups for which the authenticated Person has at least READ_IF_PARTICIPANT access. Basically this means that a Participant has access to the information describing the other Participants and Persons in a team that he or she is a member of.
